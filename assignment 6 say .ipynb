    "# object-oriented programming (OOP)\n",
    "\n",
    "Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming language model in which programs are organized around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic. An object can be defined as a data field that has unique attributes and behavior. Examples of an object can range from physical entities, such as a human being that is described by properties like name and address, down to small computer programs, such as widgets. This opposes the historical approach to programming where emphasis was placed on how the logic was written rather than how to define the data within the logic.\n",
    "The first step in OOP is to identify all of the objects a programmer wants to manipulate and how they relate to each other, an exercise often known as data modeling. Once an object is known, it is generalized as a class of objects that defines the kind of data it contains and any logic sequences that can manipulate it. Each distinct logic sequence is known as a method and objects can communicate with well-defined interfaces called messages.\n",
    "Simply put, OOP focuses on the objects that developers want to manipulate rather than the logic required to manipulate them. This approach to programming is well-suited for programs that are large, complex and actively updated or maintained. Due to the organization of an object-oriented program, this method is also conducive to collaborative development where projects can be divided into groups. Additional benefits of OOP include code reusability, scalability  and efficiency\n",

    "# Benefits of oop\n",
    "•\tIt provides a clear modular structure for programs which makes it good for defining abstract datatypes in which implementation details are hidden\n",
    "•\tObjects can also be reused within an across applications. The reuse of software also lowers the cost of development. More effort is put into the object-oriented analysis and design, which lowers the overall cost of development.\n",
    "•\tIt makes software easier to maintain. Since the design is modular, part of the system can be updated in case of issues without a need to make large-scale changes\n",
    "•\tReuse also enables faster development. Object-oriented programming languages come with rich libraries of objects, and code developed during projects is also reusable in future projects.\n",
    "•\tIt provides a good framework for code libraries where the supplied software components can be easily adapted and modified by the programmer. This is particularly useful for developing graphical user interfaces.\n",
    "•\tBetter Productivity as OOP techniques enforce rules on a programmer that, in the long run, help her get more work done; finished programs work better, have more features and are easier to read and maintain. OOP programmers take new and existing software objects and \"stitch\" them together to make new programs. Because object libraries contain many useful functions, software developers don't have to reinvent the wheel as often; more of their time goes into making the new program"

    "# Difference between function and method\n",
    "A function is a piece of code that is called by name. It can be passed data to operate on (i.e. the parameters) and can optionally return data (the return value). All data that is passed to a function is explicitly passed.\n",
    "A method is a piece of code that is called by a name that is associated with an object. In most respects it is identical to a function except for two key differences:\n",
    "•\tA method is implicitly passed the object on which it was called.\n",
    "•\tA method is able to operate on data that is contained within the class (remembering that an object is an instance of a class - the class is the definition, the object is an instance of that data)"

    "A class can have subclasses that can inherit all or some of the characteristics of the class. In relation to each subclass, the class becomes the superclass.\n",
    "Subclasses can also define their own methods and variables that are not part of their superclass.\n",

    "In object-oriented programming (OOP), objects are the things you think about first in designing a program and they are also the units of code that are eventually derived from the process. In between, each object is made into a generic class of object and even more generic classes are defined so that objects can share models and reuse the class definitions in their code. Each object is an instance of a particular class or subclass with the class's own methods or procedures and data variables. An object is what actually runs in the computer."
